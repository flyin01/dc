    "Rectangular data or tabular data is the a common form of data pandas is design to work with it.  \n",
    "Each row is an observation and each column is a property or attribute. In pandas this rectangular data is represented as a `DataFrame` object. Other programming languages has something similar, `SQL` has `data table` and `R` also has `data.frame`. Every column have the same data type on each row but different columns can have different data types.  \n",

    "`df.head()` method displays the first rows (default is 5)  \n",
    "`df.indo()` method displays the names of columns, data types they contain and if there are any missing alues.  \n",
    "`df.shape` attribute shows the number of rows followed by the number of clolumns, e.g `(8,7)`  \n",
    "`df.describe()` method calculates some summary statistics for numerical columns.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A `DataFrame` consists of three different components accessible using attributes.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "`df.values` attribute contains the data values in a 2D numpy array  \n",
    "`df.columns` attribute contains the labels of the column names as index object.  \n",
    "`df.index` attribute contains row numbers of row names as index object. Note: Row labes are stored in `.index` and not in `.rows`!  \n",
